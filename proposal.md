## JS Project Proposal: Hopalong-Attractor-Fractal-Visualizer

### Background

The Hopalong Attractor equation was discovered by Barry Martin of Aston University in Birmingham, England.  The distribution of points is generated by iteration over two equations known as the Martin map.  A previous visualizer created by Iacopo Sassarini is available at [this link
](https://erppy.co)

The basic premise of the visualizer is the render many two-dimensional planes of Hopalong Attractors and slowly move them from the back of a box created with three.js towards the camera.  I intend to add functionality to what has been done by Iacopo Sassarini by allowing the user to change parameters of the three.js box and the Hopalong equations.

### Functionality & MVP  

With this Hopalong Attractor Fractal Visualizer, users will be able to:

- [ ] Change the speed of movement and rotation
- [ ] Set the parameters for the rendering algorithm
- [ ] Hide all extraneous data
- [ ] Change the camera position based on the movement of the mouse

In addition, this project will include:

- [ ] An About modal describing the background of the Hopalong Attractor and inspiration for the project
- [ ] A production README

### Wireframes

This app will consist of a single screen with game board, game controls, and nav links to the Github, my LinkedIn,
and the About modal.  Game controls will include Start, Stop, and Reset buttons as well as a slider to control the speed.  On the left, three clickable shapes will be used to toggle between the types of grids available.  On the right, there will be three (or more) clickable gradient-filled rectangles used to toggle between color schemes (see Bonus Features).  Additionally, a drop-down will be added to the Controls to toggle between different rule sets (again, see Bonus Features).

### Architecture and Technologies

**NB**: one of the main things you should be researching and deciding upon while you write this proposal is what technologies you plan to use.  Identify and create a plan of attack for the major technical challenges in your project.

This project will be implemented with the following technologies:

- `JavaScript` for game logic,
- `Three.js` for 3D rendering,
- `RequestAnimationFrame.js` for animation.

In addition to the entry file, there will be two scripts involved in this project:

`render.js`: this script will handle the logic for creating and updating the necessary `Three.js` elements and rendering them to the DOM.

`hopalong.js`: this script will handle the logic for the Hopalong Attractor particle field generation.

`listeners.js`: this script will handle the logic for listening for user input

### Implementation Timeline

**Day 1**: Setup all necessary Node modules, including getting webpack up and running and `Three.js` installed. Write a basic entry file and the bare bones of all 3 scripts outlined above.  Learn the basics of `Three.js`.  Goals for the day:

- Learn enough `Three.js` to render an object in 3D space
- Learn about the parameters of the Hopalong Attractor

**Day 2**: This day should be for making further progress and beginning to implement customizable algorithm parameters.

- Complete rendering of at least one static Hopalong Attractor in front of the Three.js camera
- Start implementing user-modifiable parameters

**Day 3**: Finish basic rendering of zooming frames logic.

- Have everything rendering properly
- Come close to finishing customizable parameters


**Day 4**: Style the frontend, making it polished and professional.  Goals for the day:

- Make the styling as simple and unobtrusive as possible.
- Fix problems I may not have gotten around to yet


### Bonus features

There are many directions this fractal render engine could eventually go.  Some anticipated updates are:

- [ ] Add options for different fractal algorithms
- [ ] Randomize parameters within aesthetic boundaries
